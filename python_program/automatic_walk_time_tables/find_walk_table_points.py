    Final selection: Iteratively reduce the number of points to the maximum specified in walk_point_limit. To
    achieve this we iteratively increase a maximum derivation (drv_limit) value until we have dropped enough points.

    For this purpose, three preselected, adjacent points (A, B, and B) are used to construct a secant line
    (a straight line between A and C). Point B is now tested against the drv_limit. If C has a derivation
    bigger than the limit, C gets dropped or moved to a new location, i.g. if the distance between point C and a
    point on secant line at the same location is bigger than drv_limit, C gets dropped or moved.

    Point B gets moved if and only if after the removal of point B a previously dropped point D is now further way
    from the secant line than the drv_limit. In this case be gets dropped and D gets added again, thus be gets
    replaced with point D in ths case. In all other cases B gets dropped.

    Once we've checked that. Points A, B, and C are shifted. If B gets dropped, A remains the same.
    This process is repeated until we have reached the walk_point_limit. If no point gets dropped during a pass
    through the selected points, we increase drv_limit by 2 meters and try again.
