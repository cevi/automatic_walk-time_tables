# Run the Frontend/Webinterface Locally

For development without docker, you can run the following commands.

1) Install node version 16, e.g. by using the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

2) Launch the application by running the following command inside the `./frontend` directory.

   ```bash
   npm install # install dependencies
   npm start # start local server
   ```
   If you run the application locally, Angular assumes the backend server is running
   at <a href="http://localhost:5000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">localhost:5000</a> (see
   [Environment Variables - How the Application Behaves](/documentation/introduction/environment.html#environment-variables-how-the-application-behaves)).

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Update Dependencies

To update the dependencies, run the following command inside the `./frontend` directory.

```bash
npm update
```

To update the Angular version, follow the [Angular Update Guide](https://update.angular.io/).
